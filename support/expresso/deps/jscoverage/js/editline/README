The files in this directory provide simple line-editing and history
support for the standalone javascript engine, through the 'editline'
library.

editline has only been enabled for those platforms on which it is
known to build; to try it on a different platform, define JS_EDITLINE
before building.  Line editing (and js.c) is not a supported feature
of the javascript library, so your mileage my vary.

The editline API is a compatible subset of the FSF readline API; if
you have readline installed and would like to link to that instead,
define JS_READLINE.  Note that the readline library is distributed
under the GPL, so any resulting binaries are not legally
distributable.

The editline files used here have been modified to work with the js
build system and to quiet some compiler warnings, and also to remove
filename-completion support.

If anyone knows of a more recent version of these files, or a site on
which they are being maintained, please let me know!

The original README file distributed with the editline library follows.



This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and recall.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright.

Configuration is done in the Makefile.  Type "make testit" to get
a small slow shell for testing.

An earlier version was distributed with Byron's rc.  Principal
changes over that version include:
	Faster.
	Is eight-bit clean (thanks to brendan@cs.widener.edu)
	Written in K&R C, but ANSI compliant (gcc all warnings)
	Propagates EOF properly; rc trip test now passes
	Doesn't need or use or provide memmove.
	More robust
	Calling sequence changed to be compatible with readline.
	Test program, new manpage, better configuration
	More system-independant; includes Unix and OS-9 support.

This contains some changes since the posting to comp.sources.misc:
	Bugfix for completion on absolute pathnames.
	Better handling of M-n versus showing raw 8bit chars.
	Better signal handling.
	Now supports termios/termio/sgttyb ioctl's.
	Add M-m command to toggle how 8bit data is displayed.

There is one known bug:
	History-searching redraws the line wrong if the text
	retrieved is shorter then the prompt.

Enjoy,
